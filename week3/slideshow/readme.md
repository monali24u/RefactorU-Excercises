Objective
--------
Create a slideshow from a set of images.

Requirements

- Define the images' sources to feed the slideshow in your controller.
- Should include next and previous buttons as well as individual buttons so users can navigate to any image in the show.
- Should support captions for each image.
- Should support auto-play, which would wait a specified time before auto transitioning between images.
- Should be able to pause auto-play functionality.
- The slideshow does not need to be animated.

Bonus
-------

Animate the slideshow using CSS transitions, or any other method. You can use a fade-in/fade-out animation, or slide the images from left to right. Which animation style is harder to implement?
