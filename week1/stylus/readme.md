Stylus as a preprocessor
--------------------

Stylus can be a powerful tool that can save you a lot of time and CSS. It is a language distinct from CSS that provides an efficient, dynamic, and expressive way to generate CSS. It Supports both an indented syntax and regular CSS style.

Remember: If using the indented syntax, watch your whitespace! We recommend the indented syntax in order to get the most out of Stylus.

Objectives
-----------
- Running the stylus command from the command line manually every time you save a .styl file can be cumbersome. Look up how to use the stylus command to watch files for changes and auto-compile.
- Explore using variables to store things like colors or values for padding/margin/etc. Make two variables called primaryColor and secondaryColor to use on a few elements.
- Using the indented syntax, style an element & one of its child elements. (Notice how the indentations let Stylus know which styles apply to which element).
- Now add both a :hover state style and media query on the parent element using the indented style and add CSS properties to test them out.
