Background
----------
The time is now to treat mobile devices as first-class citizens. Mobile devices have eclipsed desktop usage. Responsive Web Design is the set of principles and techniques that allow you to serve a single codebase that adapts to different devices. Media Queries, a new feature in CSS3, are the primary enabler. Instead of building two completely different codebases, one for mobile and one for desktop, we design and build a single site with a few rules defined for how elements should adapt within different devices.

Read the articles provided above to gain an understanding of the principles of Responsive Web Design then follow the instructions below to put them into practice.

Requirements
------------
- Create a static HTML page. You may use whatever content you like as long as you have:
A navigation bar at the top of the page. This must include at least 5 navigation links
3 paragraphs of main content (lipsum.com)
Include at least 1 large sized image (placehold.it)
Include a gallery of at least 4 smaller images
- Add css so that:
The navigation bar and the main content are centered on the page and are never wider than 960px
The links in the main navigation should be inline (side-by-side)
The gallery of images should also be inline
The large-format image should never be larger than its container
- Make it responsive!
At sub-960px width, the navigation bar and main content should scale so that it never extends past the browser edge
At sub-960px width, the navigation bar and main content should be padded away from the edge of the browser (10-20px on either side)
At the proper point (when items start to stack), collapse the main navigation so the items are now full width and stack vertically
At the proper point (when items start to stack), collapse the image gallery so the items are now full width and stack vertically
