Objective
---------
You have an image gallery and you want to show off your CSS skills by adding a cool effect. Create a card flip effect using CSS3 3D Transformations.

The transition should look like the following:

Requirements
---------
- You should mostly just modify main.css. You can modify index.html only to add classes. Leave the other CSS files as they are.
- Adjust the position of the .front and .back elements so that they are right on top of each other.
- Before doing anything fancy, lets see if we can get the basic effect working just with opacity. Using opacity, adjust the CSS so that only .front is visible.
- On hover, set the .front opacity to 0 and the .back opacity to 1.
- Look up the CSS3 transition property. Set up a transition so that you have a smooth crossfade on hover.
- Now we can build on this basic version to add the 3D transformation which creates the flip effect. Look up CSS3 3D Rotations and modify your code to create the card flip effect indicated in the screenshots above.
