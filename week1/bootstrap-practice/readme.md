Bootstrap Practice
=============

Difficulty - 2/5
---------

Skills
-----------
- HTML
- Bootstrap

Background
------------
Using Bootstrap as a CSS framework can save you a lot of valuable time.  However, Bootstrap cannot always be used for every project and you may be left on your own to build components similar to the ones pre-defined in Bootstrap.

This exercise is designed to have you build some common UI components <strong> without </strong> using Bootstrap.  You will be the one writing the CSS and JS needed to get the job done.

Objective
--------
Using bootstrap, build some of their example templates without looking at the source of the template. Try to recreate each one listed below as closely as possible.

Requirements
----------
- Build the "Jumbotron" example.
- Build the "Justified Nav" example. Note that the actual styling of the navbar (the gradient, borders, etc) is defined in a non-bootstrap stylesheet. Don't worry about the visual appearance as long as they are side-by-side!
- Build the "Carousel" example.
- Make sure that each of your builds matches the responsiveness of the example!
