- Write a function called 'tripleFive' which loops three times using a for loop. Each iteration of the loop, output 'Five!' using console.log.
    - tripleFive() 
    - Five! Five! Five!
- Write a function called 'lastLetter' which takes a single string argument and returns the last character in the string.
    - lastLetter('hello') should return 'o'
    - lastLetter('island') should return 'd'
- Write a function called 'square' which takes a single argument which is a number, and returns number * number.
    - square(3) should return 9
    - square(5) should return 25
- Write a function called 'negate' which takes a single number argument and returns the negative of that number.
    - negate(5) should return -5
    - negate(-8) should return 8
- Write a function called 'toArray' which takes three arguments and returns an array with each of those arguments as items.
    - toArray(1, 4, 5) should return [1, 4, 5]
    - toArray(8, 9, 10) should return [8, 9, 10]
- Write a function called 'startsWithA' which takes a single string argument and returns true if the given string's first letter is 'A' and false otherwise.
    - startsWithA('aardvark') should return true
    - startsWithA('bear') should return false
- Write a function called 'excite' which takes a single string argument and returns the given string plus three exclamation marks.
    - excite('yes') should return 'yes!!!'
    - excite('go') should return 'go!!!'
- Write a function called 'sun' which takes a single string argument and returns true if the string contains the word 'sun' within it. You may use the indexOf method that is built-in to strings, or you can do it manually with a for loop.
    - sun('sundries') should return true
    - sun('asunder') should return true
    - sun('catapult') should return false
- Write a function called 'tiny' which takes a single number argument and returns true if the number is between 0 and 1.
    - tiny(0.3) should return true
    - tiny(14) should return false
    - tiny(-5) should return false
- Write a function called 'getSeconds' which takes a single string argument in the format 'MM:SS' (minutes, and seconds) and returns the total number of seconds represented by that timespan.
    - getSeconds('01:30') should return 90
    - getSeconds('10:25') should return 625
